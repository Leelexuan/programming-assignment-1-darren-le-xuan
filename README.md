# 50.005 2022 Programming Assignment 1

In this assignment, you will implement a secure file upload application from a client to a secure file server. By secure, we mean three fulfilled requirements:

First, before you do your upload as the client, you should authenticate the identity of the file server so you won’t leak your data to random entities including criminals.
Secondly, you want to ensure that you’re talking to a live server too.
Thirdly, while carrying out the upload you should be able to protect the confidentiality of the data against eavesdropping by any curious adversaries.
